While price action enters consolidation in the upper third of the recent range, no breakdown has occurred, and the presence of rising demand zones affirms accumulation. Macro tailwinds from earnings and subdued geopolitical risk reduce downside volatility. The upcoming CPI and NFP releases may introduce volatility but are unlikely to structurally alter the uptrend unless data significantly overshoots expectations.",

However, strong breadth in earnings and benign financial conditions provide a supportive base. Risk-reward skews positive for swing entries on minor pullbacks, though chasing breakouts may offer reduced alpha.",
